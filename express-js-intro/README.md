In this project, I am learning the basic routing..  
how to deal with routes and deal with the http methods( GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) calls.


to acheive this we are relaying on express.js framework to handle the routes and methods.


npm install --save-dev nodemon

nodemon: helps to reload the server so that the changes reflect, otherwise we have stop and start the server.
